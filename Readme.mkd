**ranked-model** is a modern row sorting library built for Rails 3 & 4.  It uses ARel aggressively and is better optimized than most other libraries.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mixonic/ranked-model.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mixonic/ranked-model)

Installation
------------

ranked-model passes specs with Rails 3.1, 3.2, 4.0, and 4.1-beta for MySQL, Postgres, and SQLite on Ruby 1.9.2, 1.9.3, 2.0, 2.1, jruby-19mode, and rubinius where Rails supports the platform. This is with the exception of Postgres before Rails 4.0 on all platforms, which is unsupported (I'd gladly accept a PR to fix this).

TL;DR, if you are using Rails 4 and up you are 100% good to go. Before Rails 4, be wary of Postgres.

To install ranked-model, just add it to your `Gemfile`:

``` ruby
gem 'ranked-model'

# Or pin ranked-model to git
# gem 'ranked-model',
#   :git => 'git@github.com:mixonic/ranked-model.git'
```

Then use `bundle install` to update your `Gemfile.lock`.

Simple Use
----------

Use of ranked-model is straight ahead.  Get some ducks:

``` ruby
class Duck < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

Put your ducks in a row:

``` ruby
class Duck < ActiveRecord::Base

  include RankedModel
  ranks :row_order

end
```

This simple example assumes an integer column called `row_order`.  To order Ducks by this order:

``` ruby
Duck.rank(:row_order).all
```

The ranking integers stored in the `row_order` column will be big and spaced apart.  When you
implement a sorting UI, just update the resource by appending the column name with `_position` and indicating the desired position:

``` ruby
@duck.update_attribute :row_order_position, 0  # or 1, 2, 37. :first, :last, :up and :down are also valid
```

Position numbers begin at zero.  A position number greater than the number of records acts the
same as :last. :up and :down move the record up/down the ladder by one step.

So using a normal json controller where `@duck.attributes = params[:duck]; @duck.save`, JS can
look pretty elegant:

``` javascript
$.ajax({
  type: 'PUT',
  url: '/ducks',
  dataType: 'json',
  data: { duck: { row_order_position: 0 } },  // or whatever your new position is
});
```

Complex Use
-----------

The `ranks` method takes serveral arguments:

``` ruby
class Duck < ActiveRecord::Base

  include RankedModel

  ranks :row_order,           # Name this ranker, used with rank()
    :column => :sort_order    # Override the default column, which defaults to the name
  
  belongs_to :pond
  ranks :swimming_order,
    :with_same => :pond_id    # Ducks belong_to Ponds, make the ranker scoped to one pond
  
  scope :walking, where(:walking => true )
  ranks :walking_order,
    :scope => :walking        # Narrow this ranker to a scope

end
```

When you make a query, add the rank:

``` ruby
Duck.rank(:row_order)

Pond.first.ducks.rank(:swimming_order)

Duck.walking.rank(:walking)
```

Internals
---------

This libarary is written using ARel from the ground-up.  This leaves the code much cleaner
than many implementations.  ranked-model is also optimized to write to the database as little
as possible: ranks are stored as a number between -8388607 and 8388607 (the MEDIUMINT range in MySQL).
When an item is given a new position, it assigns itself a rank number between two neighbors.
This allows several movements of items before no digits are available between two neighbors. When
this occurs, ranked-model will try to shift other records out of the way. If items can't be easily
shifted anymore, it will rebalance the distribution of rank numbers across all members
of the ranked group.

Contributing
------------

Fork, clone, write a test, write some code, commit, push, send a pull request.  Github FTW!

The specs can be run with sqlite, postgres, and mysql:

```
DB=postgres bundle exec rake
```

Is no DB is specified, the tests run against sqlite.
